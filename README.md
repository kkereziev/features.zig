### TODOs:

- Create catch block and if any error occurs it should be propagated over there.
- Create better deinit flow for each future that gets created - there is a ton of memory leaks right now.
- Try to make promises generic ? See how this works when combining with function pointers(does the compile automatically do type inference based on the generic and function signature ?)
